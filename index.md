I am currently working as a postdoctoral researcher at <a href="https://cires.colorado.edu/" target="_blank">**CIRES**</a> and at <a href="https://gml.noaa.gov" target="_blank">**NOAA GML**</a>. 

My scientific career began with my studies at the <a href="https://www.goethe-university-frankfurt.de/en" target="_blank">**University of Frankfurt**</a> (Germany), where I completed my bachelor's and master's degrees in meteorology. 
I then worked on my PhD at the <a href="https://www.goethe-university-frankfurt.de/111525306/Institute_for_Atmospheric_and_Environmental_Sciences" target="_blank">**Institute for Atmospheric and Environmental Sciences**</a>, where I subsequently worked for two years as a postdoctoral researcher. During my PhD studies and postdoctoral research, I participated in two aircraft measurement campaigns with the <a href="https://www.dlr.de/en/research-and-transfer/projects-and-missions/halo-high-altitude-and-long-range-research-aircraft" target="_blank">**HALO**</a> research aircraft.
